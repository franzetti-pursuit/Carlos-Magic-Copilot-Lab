# my-first-repo
Playground for quick UI experiments and a tiny tribute to Copilot's charm.

What is this madness? ✨
- A deliberately silly, single-file static demo (`index.html`) that shows how quickly you can go from idea to pixel with suggestion-powered tinkering.
- It contains a tongue-in-cheek hero, an inline SVG "HAXX04" graphic, and playful transitions—no build, no bundler, just open-and-go.

Quick preview 🚀
- Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the page (double-click or drag into a browser tab).
- Tailwind is loaded from the Play CDN (`<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com">`) so you don't need to install anything.

Themes & interactivity 🎛️
- The demo includes **three** swappable themes: **Dark** (default), **Neon**, and **Solar**. Use the theme buttons in the header to toggle.
- Animations are intentionally playful (staggered reveals, particles, floaty graphics). The page respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility.

How it's built 🧩
- Minimal: `index.html` contains HTML, Tailwind utility classes, inline SVGs for graphics, and a tiny bit of vanilla JS for theme switching and animations.
- No build step: everything works by opening `index.html` — perfect for quick edits and copy/paste experiments.

Contributing & small print ✍️
- Want a tweak? Open a small PR that edits `index.html` and updates this README if you change behavior or add new assets.
- Keep commits focused and small (one idea per PR). If you add tooling (tests, bundlers), document how to run them in this README.

Got feedback or more madness to add? Open an issue or ping me and I'll iterate. 😄
